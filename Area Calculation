QUESTION:

Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. 

Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input format:
First input: a side of a square in integer

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Output format:

The first output should be the area of a square in integer

The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer

The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input:

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int side = sc.nextInt();
        int length = sc.nextInt();
        int breath = sc.nextInt();
        float radius = sc.nextFloat();
        System.out.println(side * side);
        System.out.println(length * breath);
        System.out.println(3.14* radius * radius);
        
    }
}
