Xinyou has been trained to drive now. Dr. Dexter wants to get to a National Conference to present Xinyou. The venue of the conference is x kms away from his workshop. He wants to know if Xinyou will be able to make it to the conference on time if he travels at y kms/h.
Write a C program module that checks if he will be able to make it to the conference on time.

 
INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT: 

Input consists of 4 lines.
The first line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the distance 'd'. 0 < d < 32767.
The second line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the speed 's'. 0 < s < 32767.
The third line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the time at which the conference begins â€“ 'ti'. 
The fourth line of input is a floating point number corresponding to the current time, 'tj'.
'ti' and 'tj'  are strictly in the 'hh.mm' format (tj<ti).
Output consists of a single string 'Yes', 'No' or 'Invalid Input'.

Xinyou has been trained to drive now. Dr. Dexter wants to get to a national conference to present Xinyou. The venue of the conference is d km away from his workshop. He wants to know if Xinyou will be able to make it to the conference in 'h' hours, driving within the city speed limit 's'.
Write a C program module that checks if he will be able to make it to the conference on time.

 
INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 3 lines.
The first line of input is a floating point number d (0 < d < 32767), which corresponds to the distance. 
The second line of input is a floating point number s (0 < s < 32767), which corresponds to the speed limit.
The third line of input is a floating point number h (0 < h < 32767), which corresponds to the time.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output consists of a single string 'Yes', 'No' or 'Invalid Input'.
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.
