Dr. Dexter has now started his trip to Shinyao. Unfortunately, he has forgotten about the fuel. There are two gas bunks on the way to Shinyao, 'A' and 'B'. As soon as his car reaches the bunk A, it runs out of fuel. Bunks A and B are 'd' miles apart. Xinyou, the robot finds out from statistics that one of the bunks provides the best quality fuel. They decide on filling the best quality fuel.
Write a C program module that finds the quantity of fuel that has to be filled at bunks A and B.
 
INPUT FORMAT:
Input consists of 4 lines.
The first line of input is an integer d (0 <  d < 32767), which corresponds to the distance between bunks A and B
The second line of input is an integer s (0 <  s < 32767), whcih corresponds to the distance between bunk A and Shinyao.
The third line of input is a floating point number 'm' corresponding to the mileage Dr.Dexter's car yields.
The fourth line of input is the character 'b' corresponding to the bunk that provides the best quality fuel. Assume that b takes values either 'A' or 'B'
Assume that bunk A lies before bunk B.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output consists of the quantities of fuel to be filled at bunks A and B, correct up to 2 decimal places.

Dr. Dexter is now in the gas bunk. He has perfectly planned his trip. He has been working keenly on the budget so that the trip goes on well. Now, he finds that there are two varieties of fuel â€“ Ordinary and Speed. Speed fuel yields him a fairly better performance than its ordinary counterpart. He wants Xinyou to find out as to which variety of fuel he must opt to stick to the budget.
Write a C program to find out the variety of fuel.

 
INPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of 5 lines.
The first line of input is a floating point number 'm', which corresponds to the mileage Dr.Dexter's car yields.
The second line and third lines of input consists of floating point numbers 'o' and 's', which corresponds to the costs of ordinary fuel and speed fuel respectively.
The fourth line of input is an integer 'd', which corresponds to the distance between the bunk and Shinyao.
The fifth line of input is a floating point number 'b', which corresponds to the budget for the fuel.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output consists of a string 'Ordinary' or 'Speed'.
