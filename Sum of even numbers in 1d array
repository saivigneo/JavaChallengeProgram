Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to ‘n’ , the size of the array. The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer sample output for details.

Sample Input :

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output 1:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //Write your code
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int [] arr = new int[n];
        int sum  = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
            if(arr[j]%2==0){
                sum = sum + arr[j];
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The sum of the even numbers in the array is "+sum);
    }
}
