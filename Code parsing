//Code parsing

Little Vitaly loves different algorithms. Today he has invented a new algorithm just for you. Vitaly's algorithm works with string s, consisting of characters "x" and "y", and uses the two following operations at runtime:

Find two consecutive characters in the string, such that the first of them equals "y", and the second one equals "x" and swap them. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string.
Find, in the string, two consecutive characters, such that the first of them equals "x" and the second one equals "y". Remove these characters from the string. If there are several suitable pairs of characters, we choose the pair of characters that is located closer to the beginning of the string.
The input for the new algorithm is string s, and the algorithm works as follows:

If you can apply at least one of the described operations to the string, go to step 2 of the algorithm. Otherwise, stop executing the algorithm and print the current string.
If you can apply operation 1, then apply it. Otherwise, apply operation 2. After you apply the operation, go to step 1 of the algorithm.
Now Vitaly wonders, what is going to be printed as the result of the algorithm's work if the input receives string s.



INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a non-empty string s.
It is guaranteed that the string only consists of characters "x" and "y". It is guaranteed that the string consists of at most 50 characters. It is guaranteed that as the result of the algorithm's execution won't be an empty string.
The output is to print the string that is printed as the result of the algorithm's work if the input of the algorithm input receives string s.
Text that is bold represents the input.

//Boy or glass
Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that, they talked very often and eventually, they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise, she is a female. You are given a string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.



INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase letters, which corresponds to the user name. This string contains at most 50 letters.
Output is If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
Refer to the sample input and output for formatting details.
Text in bold represents the output.
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 1:

IGNORE HIM!
SAMPLE INPUT & OUTPUT 2:
