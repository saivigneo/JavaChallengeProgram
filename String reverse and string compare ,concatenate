public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //Write your code
        //get input from user
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.nextLine();

hello

hello

Strings are same

    {
        //Write your code
        //get input from user
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s1 = sc.nextLine();
        String s2 = sc.nextLine();
        if(s1.equals(s2)){
            System.out.println("Strings are same");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("Strings are not same");
        }
    }
}
