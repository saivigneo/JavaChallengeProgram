//Maximum element in each row
There are some students in the class. The class Advisor needs a recruitments process for above 60% students. In each and every row there was a student above 60% . Help your advisor to find the students in each row.

Input Format:

The input consists of (m*n+2) integers. The first integer corresponds to m, the number of rows in the matrix and the second integer corresponds to n, the number of columns in the matrix. The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix. The elements are read in rowwise order, first row first, then second row and so on. Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 10.

 Output Format:

//Maximum element in each column

In a family the people are arranged in rows and columns. Male persons in the families arranged in a row and females are arranged in a column. Find the biggest women in the each column.Help me to find the biggest women. 

Write a  program to find the maximum element in each column of the matrix.
